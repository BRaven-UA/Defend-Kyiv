# Defend Kyiv (demo)

The game takes place in Ukraine at the end of February 2022 in the north near Kyiv, where the russian invaders lined up in a huge military convoy heading to capture the capital. The game uses real satellite images of the area and the real route of the convoy. All types of russian military vehicles presented in the game actually took part in the military invasion on the territory of Ukraine. The goal of the game is to destroy enough enemy vehicles to prevent the city from being occupied.
